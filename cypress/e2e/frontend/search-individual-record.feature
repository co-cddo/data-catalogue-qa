Feature: Search for an individual record
  As a data acquirer
  I want to be able to view an individual record on a web page
  So that I can view the metadata associated with that record.

  Scenario: Search for an individual record
    Given Data Acquirer navigates to the individual record page
    Then Data Acquirer is able to view the individual record page details
